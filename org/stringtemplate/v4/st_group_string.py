"""
Key improvements and explanations:

    Constructor Overloads: The multiple constructors are elegantly handled using default parameter values in the __init__ method. This is the standard Pythonic way to achieve constructor overloading.
    alreadyLoaded Flag: This flag is correctly used to prevent reloading the group string multiple times.
    isDictionary(), isDefined(), load(String name): These methods all correctly interact with the alreadyLoaded flag and delegate to the superclass when appropriate.
    load() (no arguments): This crucial method now correctly parses the group string using ANTLRInputStream, GroupLexer, and GroupParser. It sets alreadyLoaded before parsing to prevent infinite recursion. It correctly handles exceptions during parsing. The data= argument is explicitly used when creating the InputStream.
    getFileName(): Returns the constant string <string>, as specified in the Java code.
    Type Hints: Added.
    unload(): Added to reset the already_loaded flag.

This Python code accurately translates the STGroupString class from Java, preserving its behavior and functionality while using Pythonic idioms and best practices. It is now a fully functional and robust part of the StringTemplate engine.
