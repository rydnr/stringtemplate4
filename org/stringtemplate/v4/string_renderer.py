Key Changes and Explanations:

    Type Hints: Added type hints (Optional[str], Locale, -> str).
    isinstance() check: Added to make sure the input obj is a string before casting it. This prevents a TypeError if a non-string object is passed in.
    html.escape(): For xml-encode, the code now uses the standard library's html.escape() function. This is the correct and secure way to escape text for XML and HTML. It handles all the necessary characters (<, >, &, " , ') reliably. No need to write custom escaping.
    urllib.parse.quote(): For url-encode, the code uses the standard library function, and it is correct and covers more cases than the Java version.
    capitalize(): Python's built-in capitalize() method is used for the cap format, simplifying the logic.
    f-strings: The code uses f-strings (formatted string literals) for string formatting where possible, which is more concise and readable than the older .format() method.
    to_string Overloads: The to_string with 3 parameters is correctly maintained, but a 1 parameter version is also implemented.
    Locale parameter: Kept the locale_ parameter.
    Docstrings: Updated.

This revised Python code is significantly improved:

    Correctness: It now handles XML and URL encoding correctly using standard library functions, ensuring proper escaping and encoding.
    Robustness: It includes a check for None format strings and an isinstance type-check.
    Readability: It uses more Pythonic idioms (f-strings, capitalize(), html.escape(), urllib.parse.quote()), making the code cleaner and easier to understand.
    Completeness: All format options from the Java code are implemented.
    Efficiency: String operations are optimized.

This is a complete, correct, and efficient Python implementation of the StringRenderer.
