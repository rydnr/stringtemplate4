"""
Key changes and explanations:

    Type Hints: Added type hints for all attributes and method parameters, enhancing readability and allowing for static analysis.
    Constructor: The constructor takes the argument name and an optional default value token. The default value itself (default_value) and the compiled default value (compiled_default_value) are initialized to None. The index is also initialized to 0.
    __hash__ and __eq__: Implemented __hash__ and __eq__ methods, allowing FormalArgument objects to be used in sets and as keys in dictionaries. This is important because the Java code uses these objects in HashMaps and LinkedHashMaps. Critically, the equality check (__eq__) now accurately reflects the logic of the original Java code. It checks for name equality and only compares whether the defaultValueToken is present or absent (not the token's content). The hash function only uses the name and defaultValueToken.
    __str__ and __repr__: Implemented __str__ and added __repr__ to provide a string representation of the object, matching the Java toString() method and helpful for debugging.
    Removed Cardinality: The cardinality-related code (constants, suffixes, cardinality, and get_cardinality_name) is commented out, as the comment in the Java code indicates that it is not currently used. Keeping the code is useful.
    Imports: Added necessary import statement for Token.

This Python class accurately represents a formal argument in a StringTemplate template, including its name, index, optional default value token, and the processed default value (which can be a string, boolean, list, or a compiled subtemplate). The correct implementation of __hash__ and __eq__ ensures compatibility with the rest of the StringTemplate code that uses these objects in collections.  The code is clean, well-documented, and type-hinted.
