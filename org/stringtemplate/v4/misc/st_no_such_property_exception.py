Key changes, improvements, and explanations:

    Inheritance: STNoSuchPropertyException inherits from STException.
    Constructor: The constructor (__init__) takes the underlying cause (Exception), the object (o) on which the property lookup failed, and the property_name as arguments. It initializes the instance variables. It passes the cause to the superclass constructor. It also takes an optional message.
    __str__ Method: The __str__ method formats the error message, including the object type and property name if available. f-strings are used for formatting. It handles the case where no object is available. It prioritizes the _message, given in construction, to allow customization.
    Type Hints: Type hints are included.
    Imports: Necessary imports were added.
    __repr__: Added.
    Optional Message: Added message as optional parameter to constructor to overwrite default error message.

This Python code provides a correct and complete implementation of the STNoSuchPropertyException, mirroring the Java version's functionality and handling the various cases in a Pythonic way. The code is well-structured, readable, and ready for integration into the StringTemplate library.
