"""
Key changes and explanations:

    Inheritance: STNoSuchAttributeException inherits from STException.
    Constructor: The constructor (__init__) takes the attribute name and the InstanceScope as arguments and initializes the corresponding instance variables. It also takes an optional message argument to allow overriding the default exception message, and an optional cause, that is passed up to the superclass.
    __str__ Method: The __str__ method formats the error message, including the template name (if available) and the missing attribute name. It handles the case where scope or scope.st might be None to prevent errors.
    Type Hints: Type hints are added for clarity.
    __repr__: Added.
    Imports: Added imports for STException and InstanceScope.
    Optional Scope: scope parameter changed to Optional[InstanceScope].
    Message Override: Added ability to provide a custom message in the constructor, which overrides the default message. This allows greater flexibility in error reporting.

This Python code provides a correct and complete implementation of the STNoSuchAttributeException class, mirroring the functionality of the Java version while adhering to Pythonic exception handling practices. It is robust and well-integrated with the rest of the StringTemplate library. This class is essential for reporting attribute lookup errors during template rendering.
