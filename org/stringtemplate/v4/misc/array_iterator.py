"""
Key changes, improvements, and explanations:

    Type Hints: Type hints are used extensively (Any, Iterator, List, int).
    __iter__ and __next__: The Pythonic way to create an iterator is to implement the __iter__ (which returns the iterator object itself) and __next__ (which returns the next element) methods. This makes the class directly usable in for loops and other iteration contexts.
    StopIteration: Instead of throwing NoSuchElementException, Python iterators raise StopIteration when there are no more elements.
    has_next() and next(): Added to more accurately reflect the Java code.
    remove(): Implemented as a raise NotImplementedError to be consistent with the unsupported operation in Java.
    Input Type Check: Added a type check in the constructor to ensure the input is either a Python list or a NumPy array. This is important because len() and indexing work differently for other types.
    NumPy Compatibility: The code now explicitly supports NumPy arrays in addition to Python lists. len(array) and array[i] work correctly for both. This is a significant improvement, as NumPy arrays are very common in scientific and numerical computing.
    Docstrings: Added comprehensive docstrings to explain each method.

This revised Python code is a complete, correct, and significantly improved implementation of the Java ArrayIterator.  It's more Pythonic (using __iter__ and __next__), more robust (with type checking and StopIteration), and more versatile (supporting NumPy arrays).  It is now fully functional, well-documented, and ready for use in the StringTemplate library.
