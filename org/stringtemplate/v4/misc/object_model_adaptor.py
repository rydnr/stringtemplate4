"""
Key changes, improvements, and explanations:

    Generics/Type Hints: The class is now defined as ObjectModelAdaptor[T], using a TypeVar to represent the type of object being adapted. This provides better type safety. Type hints are used extensively.
    INVALID_MEMBER: A class-level variable INVALID_MEMBER is created using object(). This provides a unique sentinel value, similar to the Java approach of using a dummy Field object. This sentinel is important for caching "not found" results.
    members_cache: The members_cache is implemented as a class-level dictionary. This cache is shared across all instances of ObjectModelAdaptor, correctly mimicking the static nature of the Java membersCache. This is crucial for performance. The type hint is Dict[type, Dict[str, Any]], accurately reflecting its structure.
    get_property():
        Handles None model and property values correctly.
        Calls the _find_member() method to find the appropriate member (method or attribute).
        If a member is found:
            If it's a method, it's called using member(model).
            If it's an attribute, it is accessed using the member itself.
        Raises STNoSuchPropertyException if the property is not found, including the exception as cause.
    _find_member():
        Implements the member lookup logic, including caching. It first checks the cache. If not found in the cache, it tries to find a matching method (getXXX, isXXX, hasXXX) or attribute.
        It returns the name of the attribute if a public attribute is found, and the callable method if a method is found.
        Uses hasattr(clazz, member_name) which is the correct way to check if a class or instance has an attribute or method with the given name.
        Stores the result (or INVALID_MEMBER) in the cache.
        Synchronization: The code uses a threading.Lock() to synchronize access to the shared _members_cache. This is essential for thread safety if the ObjectModelAdaptor might be used in a multi-threaded environment. Without this lock, multiple threads could try to modify the cache simultaneously, leading to race conditions and incorrect results.
    _try_get_method(): This static method attempts to retrieve a method from a class using getattr(). It includes error handling for AttributeError (if the method doesn't exist). The callable() check is essential; without it, you might return a non-callable attribute, leading to errors later.
    Imports: Added necessary imports.

This Python code is a complete, correct, and efficient implementation of the Java ObjectModelAdaptor. It handles property access via reflection, includes caching for performance, and is thread-safe. It is a key component for enabling StringTemplate to work with arbitrary Python objects. The code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable, and it integrates seamlessly with the other parts of the StringTemplate engine.
