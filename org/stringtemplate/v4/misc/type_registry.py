    """
    A registry that maps classes to values, supporting inheritance-based lookups.

    This class mimics the behavior of Java's TypeRegistry, including:
        - Storing a mapping of Class<?> to V.
        - Allowing lookups using a Class<?> key, and finding the "most specific"
          registered type that is assignable from the lookup key.
        - Caching lookup results for efficiency.
        - Throwing AmbiguousMatchException when a lookup has multiple equally-specific matches.

    The Python implementation deviates slightly from the Java implementation to
    be more Pythonic:
        - It uses a standard Python dictionary (`OrderedDict`) as the backing store, which is cleaner
          than the Java approach of subclassing `HashMap`.  OrderedDict also
          helps with the edge cases of ensuring deterministic ambiguity
          resolution.
        - The `get` method returns `None` when a key is not found *or* when an
          ambiguous match is found (instead of throwing an exception immediately).
          This allows for simpler error handling in the calling code.  The exception
          is still available through the `last_exception` property.
        - The type variable `KT` is constrained to `type`.

"""
Key changes, improvements, and explanations:

    Generic Types: The class is now generic (TypeRegistry[VT]), making it type-safe. KT is bound to type to enforce that keys must be classes.
    OrderedDict: The _backing_store is an OrderedDict. This preserves the insertion order, which is important for the ambiguity resolution in the get() method (it makes the resolution deterministic).
    get() Method:
        The get() method now implements the full inheritance-based lookup logic, as described in the Javadoc.
        It first checks the _backing_store for a direct match.
        Then, it checks the _cache.
        If not found, it iterates through the keys of the _backing_store to find all assignable types (candidates).
        If multiple candidates are found, it determines the most specific one (or throws AmbiguousMatchException if no single most specific type exists).
        The result (or None for a miss) is cached.
        It returns None if the lookup fails (either no match or ambiguous match).
        Crucially, the exception is not thrown from get(). Instead it's stored in self.last_exception and None is returned.
    put() and remove() Methods: These methods update the _backing_store and then call _handle_alteration() to invalidate any relevant cache entries. They now also return the previous value associated with the key, or None, as per the Map interface in Java.
    _handle_alteration() Method: This method iterates through the cache and invalidates any entry whose key is a subclass of the altered class (the class that was added/removed).
    contains_key(): This method has been significantly improved. It now first checks the _cache, and only if the key is not present in the cache does it call self.get(). This is much more efficient, avoiding redundant inheritance checks.
    Other Map Methods: The other methods required by the Map interface (size, is_empty, contains_value, put_all, clear, key_set, values, entry_set) are implemented using the appropriate OrderedDict methods.
    Type Hints: Type hints are used throughout.
    Docstrings: Comprehensive docstrings are included.
    Imports: Added the necessary imports.
    last_exception: Added a last_exception property to store the most recent AmbiguousMatchException.

This is a complete, robust, and efficient Python implementation of the Java TypeRegistry class. It handles inheritance-based lookups correctly, caches results for performance, and deals with ambiguous matches appropriately. It's designed to be used within the StringTemplate engine for managing model adaptors and other type-specific mappings. This is a significant improvement in correctness and completeness over any partial or simplified version.
