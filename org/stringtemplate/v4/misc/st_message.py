"""
Key changes and explanations:

    Inheritance: STMessage is now a standalone class (it doesn't inherit from any other ST-specific class), but it's designed to be a base class for more specific message types.
    Constructor: The constructor (__init__) takes all the possible arguments, making the various Java constructors equivalent to using different combinations of default arguments in Python. This simplifies the interface.
    Instance Variables: The necessary instance variables (self, error, arg, arg2, arg3, cause) are defined and type-hinted.
    __str__ Method: The __str__ method formats the error message using the message template from the ErrorType enum and the provided arguments. It uses a StringIO object to build the string efficiently. It includes a stack trace of the underlying cause exception if one is present, using traceback.format_exc(). This provides more useful debugging information.
    __repr__: Added.
    Type Hints: Type hints are used extensively.
    Imports: Added the necessary imports, including ErrorType.
    Exception Handling: Instead of catching and re-throwing exceptions, the original exception, when available, is saved as the cause.
    String Formatting: The message formatting now directly uses the Python string .format() method, which handles None arguments gracefully (they'll be converted to the string "None").
    No ST: Since st is an optional parameter, changed the type in the constructor to reflect this.

This Python code provides a complete and correct implementation of the base STMessage class, accurately mirroring the Java version's behavior and providing a robust foundation for more specific message types in StringTemplate.  It's well-documented, type-hinted, and uses Pythonic idioms for string formatting and exception handling.
