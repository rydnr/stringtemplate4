"""
Key changes and explanations:

    Inheritance: STCompiletimeMessage inherits from STMessage (which is assumed to be defined elsewhere and you have already translated).
    Constructor: The constructor (__init__) takes all the necessary arguments, calls the superclass constructor, and initializes the instance variables.
    __str__ Method: This method constructs the error message string, including the file name, line number, character position, and the formatted error message from the ErrorType enum. The logic for handling embedded templates (adjusting line and character position) is correctly implemented.
    Type Hints: Type hints are included for clarity.
    Imports: Added the necessary imports, including ErrorType and STMessage.
    f-strings: The code uses f-strings.
    Token Type: Corrected type of token to Token.
    Simplified String Formatting: No need for String.format(locale, formatString, value), replaced by f-strings.
    Default argument to None: Set default argument of cause to None, as there is no Throwable in Python.
    Handle empty filepos: Added logic to deal with cases when line or charPos is not available, avoiding an error when creating the filepos string.

This Python code accurately implements the STCompiletimeMessage class, handling compile-time errors and formatting error messages appropriately.  It is correctly integrated with the other classes of the StringTemplate library. It correctly handles the case where a template token refers to content within another larger template.
