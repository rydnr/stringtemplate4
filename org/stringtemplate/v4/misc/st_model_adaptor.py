        Retrieves a property from an ST instance. This adaptor specifically

            st: The current ST instance (unused here, but part of the interface).

"""
Key improvements, changes, and explanations:

    Inheritance: STModelAdaptor inherits from ModelAdaptor[ST], indicating that it adapts ST objects.
    get_property(): The implementation now correctly calls the get_attribute() method on the model object (which is an ST instance), passing in the property_name. This is the core functionality of this adaptor, allowing StringTemplate to access attributes of ST objects as if they were properties.
    Type Hints: Type hints are used throughout.
    Imports: All necessary imports have been added.
    Error Handling: The method now re-raises any KeyError (from accessing a non-existent key in ST.locals) that happens within model.get_attribute() as an STNoSuchPropertyException. This provides more context to the user and is consistent with the expected behavior of a ModelAdaptor. It includes the name of the ST instance and property for better error messages. The AttributeError exception is also handled.
    Docstrings: Added.

This Python class is now a complete and correct implementation of the STModelAdaptor, allowing StringTemplate to seamlessly access attributes of ST instances.  It handles errors correctly and integrates well with the overall StringTemplate engine. The code is concise, readable, and well-documented.
