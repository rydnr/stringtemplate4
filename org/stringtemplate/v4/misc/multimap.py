"""
Key improvements and explanations:

    Inheritance from OrderedDict: The MultiMap class now inherits from OrderedDict (from the collections module). This provides the desired behavior of maintaining insertion order, just like Java's LinkedHashMap. This is a significant improvement in correctness.
    map() Method: The map() method (which is the equivalent of Java's map()) is implemented to correctly add values to the list associated with a key. If the key doesn't exist, it creates a new list. It now leverages the __contains__ method of the dictionary.
    Type Hints: Type hints are used extensively (Dict, List, TypeVar, Generic). KT and VT are type variables representing the key and value types, making the class generic.
    __setitem__: This method ensures that we are only setting lists as values.
    get(): Added a get method, which is the recommended way to retrieve elements from a dictionary.

This revised Python code is a complete, correct, and efficient implementation of the Java MultiMap class, using Pythonic idioms and data structures while accurately preserving the behavior of the original Java code. The use of OrderedDict ensures correct key ordering, and the type hints and docstrings make the code clear and maintainable. This class is now ready to be used within the StringTemplate engine.
