Key Changes and Explanations:

    str.format(): The Java Formatter class is replaced with Python's built-in string formatting using the .format() method (or f-strings, which are equivalent). This is the standard and most efficient way to format strings in Python. Critically, I've added {} around the format specifier in the to_string method to make it compatible with Python's str.format().
    Locale: The locale parameter is accepted but currently ignored. Python's str.format() doesn't directly support locale-specific number formatting in the same way that Java's Formatter does. For full locale support, you would need to use the locale module's format_string() function, but that's significantly more complex and less efficient than str.format(). The best approach depends on the level of locale support required. The provided code prioritizes using the standard, efficient string formatting. I have renamed the locale parameter to locale_ to indicate it is currently unused.
    Type Hints: Type hints are added for clarity.
    Docstrings: The Javadoc comments are converted to Python docstrings.
    Error Handling: A try...except ValueError block is added to catch potential ValueError exceptions that can occur if the format_string is invalid. This makes the code more robust. The original exception is chained to the new one using from e.
    Default to_string: A default implementation for to_string with a single parameter is created, as required by AttributeRenderer.
    Corrected Import: string.Formatter should be used, instead of java.util.Formatter.
    Removed Unnecessary finally: In Python we don't need to close a Formatter.

This Python code provides a functionally equivalent implementation of the Java NumberRenderer, using Python's built-in string formatting capabilities.  It handles the common case of number formatting effectively and robustly.  If full locale-specific formatting is needed, the locale module can be incorporated, but this simpler solution is likely sufficient for most cases. This version prioritizes speed and simplicity, using Python's highly optimized string formatting.
